# ComputerGraphicsProgramming_2D-DrawingApplication

## If you want to test the applciation, head over to the "Test" directory/folder under "2D_DrawingApp" directory/folder and run the .exe file

Many off-the-shelf packages utilise graphics drawing functionality (e.g. interior design, 3D-modelling, computer gaming). The goal of this assignment is to build a basic shape-drawing application from first principles


## I have broken this project into two parts.

#### Part 1: Initial working framework (Around 70% Completed - Projected completion date: 14 March 2022)
#### Part 2: Testing and Feature releases (Yet to start - Projected completion date: 4 April 2022)
